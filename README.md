This code allows for easy lookup and organization of all Internet registrars. What this means is you can use this code
in your application to get information from any Internet registrar database. You can then use the data you find as you see fit.
Only a way to get the information is provided, not to save. This is in accordance with AFRINIC acceptable use policy.

You may have noticed that AFRINIC is not included. APNIC is capable of querying AFRINIC.
There is no point in querying AFRINIC directly

This is one of my first attempts at releasing code publicly. I also usually do not write in an Object Oriented way,
so do not be surprised if it is not up-to-par. I try my best, but can not give any guarantees. I tried to write it in a redistributable way. This code will continuously be improved so that is more readable, and more easily usable.
